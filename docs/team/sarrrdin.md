### Project: `CLIMods`

`CLIMods` is a desktop application that allows students to plan out their timetable with the use of a Command Line
Interface. `CLIMods` allows users to manage their modules much faster than doing it on the common website
that most NUS students use [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.
