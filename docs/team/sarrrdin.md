### Project: `CLIMods`

`CLIMods` is a desktop application that allows students to plan out their timetable with the use of a Command Line
Interface. `CLIMods` allows users to manage their modules much faster than doing it on the common website
that most NUS students use [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to pick lessons in selected modules
    - What it does: Allow users to pick lessons for selected modules
    - Justification: This feature enhances the product tremendously because it allows users to easily pick lessons 
      hence organizing their respective timetables based on most updated information on NUSMods. The lesson timings, 
      days and venues will also be displayed.  
    - Highlights: This feature will check if lesson type is available, and later check if lesson code is available / 
      valid based on the lessons that the module offers in the particular semester.
