### Project: `CLIMods`

`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. Power users of the command line/terminal will be able to
plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the user guide via the `help` command.
    * What it does: Show our website in a window via the `help` command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing the user to easily access the documentation.

* **Project management**:
    * To be added

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
