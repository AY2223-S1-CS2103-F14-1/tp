`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. It is primarily optimised for the use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Power users
of the command line/terminal will be able to plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it
on [nusmods.com](https://www.nusmods.com).

## FAQs
1. What is a `regex` expression?

Ans: It stands for `regular expression` and is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.
To learn more about regex, you can refer to [this tutorial](https://regexone.com).

2. Why can't I visit external links?

Ans: You are likely coming from our application via the `help` command.  It is intended for the user
to only view our website (including the user guide) via the command.  If you wish to visit any external links,
you can copy the link and paste it into your favourite browser!

3. Can I update the json file?

Ans: No! Do not edit the json files on your own! Instead, you should use the command line interface provided by
CLIMods. We do not take any responsibility for any unexpected behaviour if you insist on editing the json files.

4. Why is the application not displaying any modules?

Ans: CLIMods requires internet access because we fetch module data from NUSMods API.  Please ensure that you have
internet access before launching CLIMods.
